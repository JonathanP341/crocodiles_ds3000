# Crocodile Matcher for DS 3000

This is the repository for the final group project in DS3000. We will be using this 
kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zadafiyabhrami/global-crocodile-species-dataset

The database is provided in csv format. 

To determine which type of method works best for classifying crocodiles we will each try a seperate method. We will have a method in the base jupyter notebook file and then each make a different file and test our version in those files. At the end we all push our methods and we can check which one works the best.
